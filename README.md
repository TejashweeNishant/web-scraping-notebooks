# 🕷️ Web Scraping Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks focused on **web scraping** using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and more.

Each notebook explores a different scraping task — from extracting quotes and parsing tables, to working with tags and building small scraping utilities. It's meant to be a practical set of examples and experiments in extracting structured data from the web.
